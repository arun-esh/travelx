### How it started

To have a proper database was one of the requirements of the project. While learning mongoDB, [Arunesh](https://github.com/arun-esh) came across the open databases from [mongoDB university](https://university.mongodb.com). Here is his [Proof of Completion](https://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/836e6c4a-4f7d-43ed-8ed0-24f0319d261b).

MongoDB has open-source dataset `sample_airbnb` which provides vacation home listings and their reviews. This dataset has around 5000 entries and each entry has minimum of 30 fields. We needed a dataset which has decent content and also can easily be combined with frontend.

**Initial Idea**

-   Get a front page with all the locations
    -   Add some basic info related to each location
        -   location name
        -   price
        -   summary or description
        -   number of bathrooms
        -   number of bedrooms
        -   image of the location
        -   link to detailed information about the location
-   Get few static pages
    -   Login Page
    -   Signup Page
    -   About
    -   Contact us

## Backend

### Datasource

For this project we use the data shared by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-airbnb/). The data provided by MongoDB is a sample data from AirBnB's open source data ([link](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)).

### Database

We used mongoDB as database for this project which is a non-relational database. Here is the schema for user collection. Used mostly `type: string`, but there are other types as well. Check out the schema for **products** which has variety of types for its fields. If there is a`Required` field that means we have to add this info, otherwise we will see the appropriate error notification.

**Example**: In case, `name:` is not provided, then it will alert the user to provide the name with `message:` `Please tell us your name!`

```jsx
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	name: {
		type: String,
		required: [true, "Please tell us your name!"],
	},
	email: {
		type: String,
		required: [true, "Please provide your email"],
		unique: true,
		lowercase: true,
		validate: [validator.isEmail, "Please provide a valid email"],
	},
	photo: String,
	role: {
		type: String,
		enum: ["user", "guide", "lead-guide", "admin"],
		default: "user",
	},
	password: {
		type: String,
		required: [true, "Please provide a password"],
		minlength: 8,
		select: false,
	},
	passwordConfirm: {
		type: String,
		required: [true, "Please confirm your password"],
		validate: {
			// This only works on CREATE and SAVE!!!
			validator: function (el) {
				return el === this.password;
			},
			message: "Passwords are not the same!",
		},
	},
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

module.exports = User;
```
