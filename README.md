### How it started

To have database was one of the requirements of the project. Started googling around and decided to go with mongoDB. While learning mongoDB, [Arunesh](https://github.com/arun-esh) came across the open databases from [mongoDB university](https://university.mongodb.com). Here is his [Proof of Completion](https://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/836e6c4a-4f7d-43ed-8ed0-24f0319d261b). 

Dataset `sample_airbnb` has vocation home listings and their reviews. This dataset has around 5000 entries and each entry has minimum of 30 fields. We needed a dataset which has decent content and also can easily be combined with frontend. 

**Initial Idea**

* Get a front page with all the locations
  * Add some basic info related to locations
    * location name
    * price
    * summary or description
    * number of bathrooms
    * number of bedrooms
    * image of the location
    * link to detailed information about the location
* Get few static pages
  * Login Page
  * Signup Page
  * About
  * Contact us



## How to install

### For mac users

## Backend



### Database

We used mongoDB as database for this project which is a non-relational database. Here is the schema for user collection. Used mostly `type: string`, but there are other types as well. Check out the schema for **products** which has variety of types for its fields. If there is a`Required` field that means we have to add this info, otherwise we will see the appropriate error notification.

**Example**: In case,  `name:` is not provided, then it will alert the user to provide the name with `message:` `Please tell us your name!`



```jsx
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please tell us your name!']
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please provide your email'],
    unique: true,
    lowercase: true,
    validate: [validator.isEmail, 'Please provide a valid email']
  },
  photo: String,
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['user', 'guide', 'lead-guide', 'admin'],
    default: 'user'
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please provide a password'],
    minlength: 8,
    select: false
  },
  passwordConfirm: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please confirm your password'],
    validate: {
      // This only works on CREATE and SAVE!!!
      validator: function(el) {
        return el === this.password;
      },
      message: 'Passwords are not the same!'
    }
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema); 

module.exports = User;

```
