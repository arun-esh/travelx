Não há melhor do que acordar de manhã e ao virar da esquina estar a ribeira do Porto."

The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location."

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house."

In less than 10 minutes u’re in Vila Nova De Gaia where u can find the wineries of porto’s wine.\nThe apartment is really spacious and comfortable, perfect for 7 italian people that want to have fun in Oporto.\nSuggested!!!"

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got."

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        "comments": "This is everything we expected and hoped for in a sub-$100/night condo stay in Waikiki. This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."

        "comments": "If you're looking to spend most of your time in Hawaii outside (and not inside your room or your hotel, like with the Waikiki resort complexes) then this apartment will do the trick. It's definitely not luxurious but has the basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \nYou can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as several breakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eating dinners out. \nDavid was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \nOverall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!"

        "comments": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"

It's close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you're looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you. The dependability of the elevators, particularly during high winds, is a bit of a concern.\r\n\r\nI never met David, things were handled via airbnb email. I spoke with him on the phone when my plans changed and he was flexible in changing the dates of the original reservation.\r\n"

The location of the unit is perfect - walking distance from all the Wakiki beaches, restaurants, shops, and ABC stores. \r\n\r\nThe unit itself was a bit run-down. The cabinets and doors felt like they needed an update and the bed wasn't the most comfortable. The elevator in the building (our unit was on the 16th floor) was painfully slow but that's no fault of David's. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a great move over a hotel or something and the price is great."

The kitchen and the bathroom could use some updates, but everything is functional. Wifi worked perfectly, so no complaint on connectivity. Checking in was very easy. We followed the instruction to get the key and found our parking spot without any problem. The location of the apartment is also very convenient. A few blocks to the beach and choices of restaurants near by. There are less tourists in this part of the town, so it's more quite and less crowded"

All of this for under $110/night, I couldn't have asked for more.  If ever back in Oahu, I'll be sure to reach out to David again."

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.  David was great and yes, the next time we need to visit Waikiki, we’ll book the apt. again."

Bus 20 or the trolley was easy to access from the main road and a lot of eating places nearby. The weather was a nice 27 deg with a few showers from time to time and the Circle Island tour from Roberts or  any other tour guide was around $35  and  was worth the price. "

On oublie rapidement le côté un peu vétuste de l'immeuble et le bruit de la clim (qui fonctionne très bien pour refroidir la chambre cela dit) en appréciant :\r\n- La propreté du logement\r\n- La vue sur le port et l'océan \r\n- Tout est fonctionnel, et il y a même quelques objets utiles en plus comme une glacière souple que nous avons pu utiliser pour la plage\r\n- La piscine et le jacuzzi\r\n- La place de parking réservée pour nous\r\n- La rapidité de David pour répondre à nos questions\r\n- La petite supérette ABC store juste au coin de la rue qui dépanne bien en cas de besoin.\r\n\r\nSi nous avons la chance de revenir un jour à Hawaï, ce pourrait être dans ce même logement avec plaisir !\r\n\r\nMahalo :) "

Spent 9 days on Oahu to attend a conference and visit family. If you're looking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you'll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you're enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely! Would stay here again."

The one working elevator was broken half the time and incredibly slow the other half. Instead of waiting 30+ minutes (not exaggerating), we went up and down 16 flights of stairs. I felt awful for those on higher floors.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly not David's fault, but I hope it is fixed soon. It's ridiculous."

The only problem is the elevator because only 1 is working and most of the time it's broken. David was kind enough to help us bring down our luggages. "

The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Of note are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front, and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks)."

The parking space is a big deal because in that region the parking is very expensive. The flat is close to restaurants and is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana mall.

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you're headed out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an ocean breeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."

I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they needed to do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on. Although we were aware of the elevator issues, the wait for the elevator took up to 15 mins at times.\n\nWas located in a very nice location, close to everything. You could walk everywhere. The host was very nice and contacted us before arrival and before leaving.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a comfortable stay, I would suggest going to a hotel."

        "comments": "This rental was the first time I’ve rented lodging from Airbnb. \n\nI’m giving the review three stars instead of one star because of two reasons, \nDavid, the property manager, and the location, in Waikiki. \n\nDavid is a very nice man who listened to our concerns and acted to help out as much as he could.  David responded usually within two hours.  We were disappointed with the rental but David worked with us to adjust the rental fees.\n\nThe biggest issue we saw was that the condo was dirty.  With a cleaning fee of $100 and the nice pictures on the Airbnb website, we expected a mostly dust free and clean rental.  We talked with David about the dirty items (there were many) and a couple missing items.  He was apologetic and did his best to help salvage our stay. \n\nWe ended up leaving before the end of the rental agreement and David worked with us on that.  After our stay, David messaged me to say that the items I told him were all addressed.  I would recommend that the next renter message David and verify.\n\nBecause of the location, the free parking, and David, I would rent the condo again."

We experienced a elevators failure during Christmas holidays, so no maintenance was available for few days. The apt is on the 16th floor so climbing the stairs (small ramps of 7 steps each though) at least twice a day was quite annoying. The host offered spontanusly 255€ refund for the inconvenience."

It was an easy 3 minute walk and be on your way to anywhere in NY. \r\nThe shower is something else, the best water pressure I have experienced in a long time.\r\nI thought the decor was cool and eclectic, Greta must have an artistic streak. The Murphy bed was comfortable, and the AC unit (not pictured) kept it nice and cool.  \r\nAlthough I didn't meet her, she arranged for a neighbor to meet me and show me in. He was cool and so were any other neighbors that I met. \r\nShe also left a list of suggestions where to shop and eat, along with menus which was helpful when I needed a late night meal. \r\nHighly recommended. \r\n"

Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was incredibly well located and enjoyable. The train stops  a half block away, and there are numerous excellent restaurants and conveniences close by. Greta, the host, provides a first-rate list of recommendations.\r\n\r\nGreta was a personable, helpful and extremely welcoming host. She was very quick to respond to my online inquiries and, once we arrived, to any further requests for advice.\r\n"

The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memory foam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.  "

I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom!

We walked to the Museum of Natural History and hopped on the subway (less than one block away!) to go downtown.  Greta's place offered a sweet artful respite from the rush of the city."

I highly recommend Greta's apartment for renting.  You won't be disappointed."

The building is almost 150 years old and holds up. The location is perfect, a block to the 1 train and four blocks from the bus to LA Guardia. Everything was perfect and we already miss Samantha. Thank you Greta and we hope to be able to stay there in the future."

Greta always replied immediately in the outmost helpful way during preparation and stay. thank you Greta! we will hopefully be back soon :)\n"

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flight times from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

I even walked to Leblon from there in under 40 minutes. \n\nThe hosts met me up front and helped me with my luggage. They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. "

Hay un ventilador de techo en el living para la cama que está allí y un ventilador y aire acondicionado para la cama de dos plazas en la habitación. El departamento estaba muy limpio apenas llegamos, con todo en su lugar. Teníamos todo a nuestra disposición, todo bien ordenado.\r\nValeria nos recibió en la entrada y nos entregó las llaves en mano, nos explicó todo paso a paso del departamento. Su llavero tenía una tarjeta de descuento para el supermercado, ella nos lo prestó y nos sirvió mucho para hacer las compras. Valeria fue de gran ayuda en todo momento. Previo a llegar se contactó conmigo, también durante la estadía por si necesitábamos algo y previo a nuestra partida. Cuando la contactábamos, teníamos respuesta rápida.

En bas de l'immeuble, il y a un petit centre commercial bien pratique et une délicieuse boulangerie. Nous sommes restés 15 jours et avons énormément visité. Les plages à proximité sont vivantes. Enfin, merci à Anna Valéria pour nos échanges et ses attentions. Son ami Fernando nous a fait le transfert de l'appartement à l'aéroport. Il est adorable. Beaucoup de choses à découvrir à Rio. Nous avons fait un très beau voyage."

A dos cuadras está el hotel Atlantis... donde compré 3 tours a : Angra do Reis/Isla Grande, Búzios y uno a Cabo do Reis... todos excelentes 200 reales por persona. Recomiendo un restaurante a 2 cuadras del depto de Valeria se llama Eclipse... ricas pizas a 12,5 reales... hamburguesas con papa a 18 reales... carnes con agregados(picaña) a 33 reales... muy rico y buen precio. Valeria una excelente anfitriona, muy confiable. Uber funciona sin problema. Lo pasamos increíble."

A localização é privilegiada, a uma quadra da praia de Copacabana e a 5 min caminhando da praia do Arpoador, nossa preferida, que aliás, é bom ressaltar, estava muito bem policiada durante minha estadia de 7 dias no Rio.

Na mesma quadra do apto tem supermercado, padaria e outros comércios. Ana Valéria foi sempre simpática e nos entregou o apto limpo e com todos os itens que poderíamos precisar, inclusive duas cadeiras de praia. Excelente! Recomendamos!"

Ana Valeria is a sweet and considerate host. \n\nI would not call the apartment luxurious, but it has everything you need and it’s clean. A small kitchen, and laundry is a must for me. If you’re like me, and you love Rio, and go to the beach everyday, there is no better location. I can hop on a skateboard and get to Leme or leblon, no prob. \n\nI won’t say more, so when I want to book again it will be available!!\n\nThank you Ana Valeria. Beijão, amiga."

The flat is light and spacious, kitchen well-equipped, bed comfortable (both beds actually), and bathroom clean, with great shower pressure. Zeynep prepared a note with key information about the flat, which was great to have for reference. I especially appreciated the ground coffee and coffee maker. The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."

O bairro do Catete tem uma localização boa, conseguimos ir para a Lapa à pé e também para outros lugares como o aterro e a praia do Flamengo durante o carnaval. A estação de metrô também é perto e tem várias opções de alimentação muito próximas à casa. O layout da casa assemelha-se à um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferença com o calor que está no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que são suficientes para o número de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei lá, o banheiro não foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os hóspedes estavam mantendo-o em condições de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \r\nOutro ponto importante é que os quartos são ligados por uma porta que não tem fechadura e é bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade não é garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\r\nO preço é justo pelo que é oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se é possível fechar a comunicação dos quartos."

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area. "

Indeed, because of a flight schedule change, I asked the Airbnb host and the welcome desk of the hotel how I could manage my last night cancellation to be refund. I did exactly what they asked me to do and have been informed two days after that they refused my request of refunding... Despite the policy rules, I found it very dishonest and not correct at all as I have asked them before doing the cancellation on Airbnb and the flight confirmation.\nMoreover, I felt insulted when they made me left the welcome desk to go to the basement in order to let other clients of the hotel believe everything is perfect (I was calm and just trying to solve the issue).\nSo to conclude, the room ok but bad experience in this Airbnb that is an hotel!"

Está situado numa zona histórica e central e por isso foi possível passear sempre a pé pela cidade. É uma zona calma e a menos de 5 minutos é possível chegar ao supermercado, ao metro e a diversos centros turísticos e lojas. Tem as condições básicas e estava tudo limpo e organizado. O Fábio foi sempre atencioso e prestável desde o momento em que chegámos. Ideal para duas pessoas e para uns dias de descanso! É, sem dúvida, uma experiência a repetir."

Posizione perfetta, praticamente in centro, a pochi minuti a piedi da molti siti di interesse.

Fabio was very accommodating during check-in, even though we had arrived late in the evening, and took the time to explain the apartment and the city itself. The unit is an easy 5-minute walk from the Trindade Metro Station. There were plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and two supermarkets within 5-minutes of walking (one was open on Sundays, which saved our lives). Though the apartment is located in a lively area, an extra set of shutters provides an additional layer of sound insulation which was a big plus! \r\nCons: The apartment did not have shampoo/conditioner during our stay. Neighbors could be loud at times. Very little sound insulation on the apartment unit door.\r\nOverall: My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fabio's apartment building. If we are able to visit Porto again, we would definitely stay in this charming apartment again! Thank you, Fabio!"

Fabio really likes his hometown and took the time to show us on the map what to do and where to go. The little guidebook in French was very helpful when walking around! The apartment is just as described and just like it is on the photos:clean, functional, pretty and very well-located. It faces the street but it's not loud at night. You can walk anywhere from Fabio's flat. We had a lovely time and we were very happy in Porto :)"

So he told us for example that we didn´t have to use public transportation, and that is absolutely true, because the apartment is so good located, that you can reach every important point by walk. But if you have to use the underground it is close to the flat, so get to the airport or the beach isn´t a problem. The flat is extremely clean, and furnished very modern, so it was a great feeling to stay here. Especially for those of you who like to party with the domestic, there are a lot of bars in the neighbourhood, which are full at night, so you can enjoy a walk at night there. I would always choose this apartment again and would recommend it to everyone. Thank you Fabio."

Fica à uma distância agradável da Ribeira para se deslocar a pé, e muito próximo das principais ruas. Fizemos tudo caminhando: Sé, Cais, Livraria Lello, Galeria de Paris (noite), Rua de Santa Catarina, e estávamos cercados de opções de bares, hamburguerias, restaurantes, locais para o pequeno almoço. É próximo as estações de metro também. O espaço está muito bem decorado e utilizado, é espaçoso, e bem iluminado. Possui uma cozinha equipada para quem desejar, ótimas roupas de cama, duas sacadinhas muito agradáveis. Foi uma ótima experiência e quando voltarmos ao Porto, este espaço será nossa primeira opção. "

O apartamento tem realmente uma ótima localização (mesmo!) e espaço suficiente e agradável para um casal. Tudo estava muito limpo e cheiroso, a cozinha bem equipada, cama confortável e a sacada é um adicional agradável. Há opções de café, pubs e bares na própria rua do apartamento. Mais uma vez, tivemos a certeza que esse é um sítio para quem pretende desfrutar a cidade em um local próximo de todos os pontos turísticos a uma distância tranquila a pé, próximo a comércio, opções para refeições, perto de estações de metro e transportes públicos. Agradecemos a estadia, Fábio. \n"

La zona de aliados es de las mejor situadas para visitar Oporto y el piso está en una calle paralela a la plaza por lo que está cerca de todo sin estar en medio del ruido. Las únicas dos pegas que ponemos son; primera que habían muchas obras en la calle pero es algo circunstancial, durante el fin de semana no escuchamos nada, y segunda que el colchón era un poco malo, se te clavan los muelles."

Fabio was a great host, and offered us some excellent local suggestions on where to eat.

There is a nice queen sized bed, closets for storage, and a nice little kitchen with stove and refrigerator.   The room has good natural light and clearly has been recently renovated.   So, while the exterior of the building and hallways look a bit old and worn, the apart,ent itself is quite nice and comfortable.   There are numerous restaurants and bars to visit nearby.  There is also parking available just right up the street.  We liked this apartment and would definitely consider staying there again."

Everything is brand new and super clean. We especially loved the huge, fluffy towels.  There is a full kitchen and the shower is great too. The tv has international channels and that was also an appreciated plus.  Fabio was extremely accomodating with the check in and out and made our short stay a complete success. "

His place is in the center and the street itself has a lot of bars, restaurants, market & laundry service if you don't feel like walking anywhere. Fabio was very accomodating and explained everything in the apartment when he checked us in. He even sent a message to check if we needed anything. Do not miss out if you can book his place!"

He also wrote down a list of restaurants that he liked. He told us to get in touch with him any time if we had more questions. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils, coffee maker, kettle, stove, etc. there was even salt, pepper and oil. Much appreciated as my husband and I cooked breakfast every morning. We LOVED the location. We walked everywhere from the apartment. Minutes from the Sao Bento(?) train station and many other attractions. There was a supermarket and laundromat within a few blocks as well as a variety of different cafes and restaurants. The apartment has been completely and tastefully updated and is completely secure.  We had a wonderful five days in Fábio’s apartment and would stay there again if back in Porto. "

However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."

Didn't meet her but we managed to communicate through messenger and she explained everything well. I had no problems checking into her home on my own. Just be sure to take the odd numbered elevator and remember the building door gate is closed after 10pm. Also, the night bus to the airport is a short walk away on Nathan Road!"

It is spacious enough to have room for luggage and there is a desk where I was able to comfortably work. The room has very good air conditioning that keeps the room cool despite the hot and humid weather in Hong Kong.\n\nIt is very close to MTR and bus stations so it’s easy to get around if you feel like exploring. There are also shops and convenience stores nearby if you ever decide to grab a quick snack.\n\nI had a very pleasant stay at Yi’s place during the 3 nights I spent in Hong Kong."

I was not able to sleep when I was there because it was cold, and the bed blanket was very thin.  I could also hear everything going on in the living room . The neighborhood was depressing. Several people warned me about walking alone in the area late at night. I ended up spending a lot of time and money looking for an alternative place after I arrived in Hong Kong. It was close to New Year's Eve, so I had to return to this place for the last nights of my stay as I could not find an affordable hotel room. I cannot recommend this place."

        "comments": "First the good things\n The location is very very central, it is very safe, and the doorman is great\n There is a laundry in the building on the entrance floor and it automatically  includes soap. The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."

        "comments": "I stayed 5 nights in this apartment. Location is very close to Prince Edward Station (exit A; Tsuen Wan Line) and Shek Kip Mei Station (exit A; Kwun Tong Line) so it's very convenient. There are supermarkets, bakeries, and local eateries around the area.  Laundry facilities are located within the building. There is a lift to the apartment, which is a relief for travelers with heavy luggage. Inside the apartment, there's a kitchenette, which is good for getting hot or boiled water. Wifi connection is strong within apartment. Inside the bathroom, a shower curtain separates the shower and toilet areas. Hence, some people might feel cramped while showering. The room that I booked has windows and is equipped with strong aircon. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this apartment. This is a very good area to experience local Hong Kong life where one can see elderly folks, mummies with children, blue collar workers, and of course office workers mingling with each other. Though this area in Sham Shui Po is not posh, its down to earth vibes makes this place very real. "

The only very small negative we can say is the noisyness at night on the weekend BUT you can pop to the pharmacy next door and pick up some earplugs and that solves the problem!! Absolutely LOVED the location and decor of the apartment. Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)"

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."

The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! \n\nThe only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."

Not to mention the extras that I wont bother to take next time we stay like umbrellas, shopping bags, tea bags, band aids and spare blankets. Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! \nCheck in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. \nThe location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.\n The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"

The apartment is very spacious for two people and the view is amazing, we even had a great view of some fireworks on our last night. I would definitely recommend this place. Ben was also a great host and easy to communicate with!"

        "comments": "Worst Airbnb experience ever! On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."

From this place you can visit most monuments in the European side of Istanbul with the least complications (bus stop 1 min away and it serves Sishane metro in 10 min). If you take the bus to Sishane you can have 1 hour walk to most historical places in the European part. Next to his place there is a big market (both sides of a long street) with lots of local Turkish food. Just before his place, you can identify a small restaurant and a small grocery store. \n\nAli is such a great host with distinguished Turkish hospitality. He helped me several times to locate appropriate places for buying gifts. We had interesting discussions and his excellent English helped us had rich cultural exchanges. \n\nI'd recommend this place if you want to get a great value of your money and enjoy a true Turkish life experience (neighborhood and hosting)."

He never let you feel yourself like a stranger in Istanbul.\nHe was always ready to help me with everything and answer my questions about turkish culture. We had a lot of really great conversations.\nAnd his home... oh, it’s sooo admiring. There are many things which are made by Ali. So you can’t leave his home without a portion of inspiration! \nBy the way for every guest he has an gorgeous surprise :)\n\nIf you want to meet a friend, not just a host, don’t doubt - come to Ali’s home!"

К выходным в их районе огромный рынок открывается .рядом есть магазины продуктовые что удобно.в шаговой доступности минут 20 водный транспорт. Хозяин очень вежлив в совершенстве владеет английским. Всегда все объяснит и расскажет или посоветует как лучше. Смело бронируйте.рядом школа утром немного шумно но мне это не мешало. Тем более я рано вставал .находясь в Стамбуле хочется все увидеть.с удовольствием остановлюсь у Али в следующий раз."

It's exactly same as the pictures, super clean, large enough for 1 or 2 person and you need only 3 mins walk from the Museum Station. It's also close to the mart, convenience store and easy to take a taxi. What I love the most is that it's just near the Hyde Park. It means that you could walk there every morning and night with beautiful view. And comfortable bed, clean and large shower booth, big screen TV with Samsung Smart-hub, big dinning table... everything in room was ready for your perfect trip. In addition, Desireé is really kind, good-hearted host. I couldn't meet her but she always answer kindly to my messages and give help everytime :D Don't miss this room!! "

Desiree was an outstanding host - providing detailed instructions on every stage of our stay, including our last day where she kindly offered for us to check out later than the arranged time.  The apartment was immaculate and really did provide a home away from home. You could seriously just turn up at his place as everything is provided for the guest's use. Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.   Her guide book and restaurant recommendations were wonderful.  Highly recommended  - better than any hotel stay!  We  will be back again!  Many thanks Desiree"

Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing. I will be staying here again on my next visit. "

Desireé was exceptionally communicative and helpful, across arrival instructions and helpful hints, to being extremely flexible with my check in and departure times from the property. She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

        "comments": "This is a lovely apartment, in a hotel/serviced apartment building.  For once the pictures really don't do it justice.  The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

It is smartly decorated with comfortable furniture and lovely modern kitchen and bathroom.  There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

You are also on subway routes too!\n\nThe home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.\n\nThere are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. \n\nThe home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

The size is perfect for two people and the location is very convenient, in front of Hide Park, easy to be reached by the airport via irport likn train that stops just few steps away. All the main city attractions are at walking distance. Desiree is very kind and supporting. You can easily reach her at any time via e-mail and she answers in a few minutes. Highly  recommended!"

Despite the location right near Hyde Park, it is very quiet and we were not bothered by any noise during our stay. Desireé and Julian were lovely hosts and we appreciated the clear directions and easy check-in and check-out. We would love to stay here again when we’re in Sydney again!"

I came for the Sydney Film Festival, and the apartment was well located on Hyde Par, so I could walk to and from the venue. The studio was very comfortable and well stocked too - the little things such as tea, milk, spreads for breakfast etc were thoughtful. Picking up and dropping off the keys were a breeze and whilst I did not meet my host, she was very responsive and helpful. I can highly recommend this place for a city based jaunt. Thanks again Desiree"

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great."

We walked with a stroller & 3 young kids to both those places more than once and anything we needed was right around the block. Thanks so much Chelsea!"

Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."

Bathroom was very dirty with a broken toilet seat that was never fixed ...eventhough the staff was politely reminded each of the seven nights we stayed...holiday or no holiday...how can you be running a place like that? AC wasnt functioning, however, it was fixed by the end of second night and a fan provided as a replacement. In the end, it was exceptional as a budget place. I would highly suggest that the management take cleaning and basic hygeine into serious consideration (mold on the bathroom wall) the place could earn a 4 star experience with ease. "

My only concern is the accuracy of the photo in the listing, the photo is just a \"model\" interior of what it's gonna look like, not the real room you're gonna stay. Since I was traveling alone, I was given a room enough for a single traveler. The room in the listing is probably the room beside mine. Anyway it is not a big deal. I would still definitely stay here in the future. Thanks Mehmet!"

Cheer helped me to find a nearby Airbnb proactively.Also Pudit offered his cart to carry my guitars. It was really sweet of them.

Cheer was nice enough to let me drop off my bags earlier than check-in time so that I could go into the city for the day and was not bothered by me coming in and out late or early. She had everything I needed in the room including clean towels, cold water, a fan, books, and anything else I might need. The best part about her apartment was Mason the pup, he's VERY sweet! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. Thank you Cheer! "

Cheer's dog was absolutely adorable. Above all, I appreciated the privacy I was able to have coupled with the hospitality. \n\nIf you're looking for a spot close to Manhattan, Cheer's place is a good choice. Cheer's spot is close to various subway and bus stops, making trips into the city very easy. There are also a variety of good restaurants in the area, as well as delicious street food. \n\nI would definitely recommend Cheer's place!"

But Cheer was very helpful and accepted me as a guest. If you choose to stay with them, you are looking at a cozy bedroom well-stocked with basics like an electric kettle, a tiny fridge, water, tea bags, instant coffee sachets, creamer and sugar. So, there was no need to intrude their kitchen. Once you step out, you are welcomed to a melting pot of cultures. There are many inexpensive but good restaurants. The room was well-lit and comfortable. They really respect your privacy as well. I would definitely recommend you to stay with thffem."

The room was very clean and Cheer puts extra little touches (tea, snacks, charger cables etc) to make it very welcoming. Quiet area and family - plus their french bulldog is adorable!! The only thing I wish I had was a private lock on my room door - but other than that my time at Cheer's place was amazing!"

Annette was available to describe to the cab driver just how to get to the apartment which was extremely useful considering my taxi was metered.\r\n\r\nI had been in the air for a total period of 22 hours so I thought I would just rest a little and then go out a-discovering the Queens neighbourhood, thanks to information already supplied by Annette, but the peace and basic comfort of the room and surroundings conspired to ensuring that I did not wake up until much later in the night when most shops were closed or near to closing."

Der war auch dringend notwendig, da es in New York im Juli sehr heiß ist. Lane war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Da ich aber am nächsten Tag schon um 5 am aus dem Haus bin, kann ich recht viel mehr auch nicht sagen. Die Nacht war ruhig und angenehm. Danke für die Gastfreundschaft, Lane!"

During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at. "

Our room was very simple and small but enough for two people (I would recommend to be careful around the corners of the bed). Althought there was a slight effort of communication between us and Anette, I didn't really feel that welcomed like with our previous hosts, which might have made me look little bit uneasy. There was also very big traffic around the single bathroom which took away little bit of our privacy. In any case the apartament title is not misleading. It was a very clean and comfortable stay.\r\n"

Our stay in New York is like staying in a new home away from home. We do not have issues on safety. The walk towards Union Turnpike Station is around 10mins from our place. Lane's place is highly recommended for tourists and travelers who needed a room to stay for their vacation."

In spite of this, Lane and her sister were very gracious ensuring we made it safely and welcoming us when we got there.  The apartment was very clean and you get your own set of keys to go in and out as you wish. Overall great affordable place to stay and super friendly hosts. Would stay again."

I was actually out and about pretty much the whole time from the moment I landed so I only dealt with Anette, but she was super friendly and pleasant. They keep their place clean and presentable so be sure to take your shoes off at the door! Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"

The location is within walking distance from the Kew Gardens E/J Subway, and close to stores and fast food.  It is also right next to a major highway in Queens, which makes for easy road access.  The exact apartment is a bit hard to find so I recommend communications with Lane as the date of the stay gets closer so that she can help you find her place and coordinate your check-in.  The room is located in a third-floor apartment, and you need to use stairs to get there.  Lane is a fantastic host.  She is very responsive on email and helpful.  In all, I had a good experience because of the location and Lane's hospitality."

Anette 이 참 친절하게 이것저것 잘 이야기를 해주었습니다. 그래서 이곳에 머무는 동안 필요한 활동을 하는데 큰 문제가 없었구요. 주변을 많이 돌아다닐 시간이 없어서 많은것을 알아볼 시간은 없었지만 필요했다면 충분한 정보를 얻었을거라 믿습니다. 방과 거실을 잘 정돈해 주어서 아무런 불편없이 사용할수 있었습니다. 뉴욕에서 하루를 지내실 경우에 사용해 보시면 좋을 것 같습니다. 단지 아파트 3층에 있기때문에 무거운 물건을 가지고 올라갈때 조금은 힘들수도 있습니다. 어린 아이들과 여행을 할때는 조금 어려울수도 있을것 같네요."

I didn’t think it would be an issue, but it was very hot (32 degrees Celsius) that day so it definitely would have been nicer to have had ac.

I traveled with three other guest and we all had plenty of room to sretch out. The two living areas were used as additional sleeping place which we ended up using. Rooms in the house were on separate ends making for more privacy. \nMy flight had been delayed multiple times, Vick was nice enough to allow my guest to check in without me. He and his sister, Maria were very fast in responding to our needs and even checking on us to make sure we were okay. \nDue to late flight departure, both Vick and Maria allowed later check out times to accommodate us. I would recommend this spot for small groups and I would love to stay here again! \nThanks so much! Trip successful! "

        "comments": "My stay at David's Coggee Beach house was excellent. It's a big house with 10 large bedrooms, and common livingroom and large kitchen, deck (super nice) and bathrooms (3 bathroom area with individual shower (nice one), sink and toilet). I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there. (details: bus are down the street, Sydney downtown is 25min away, the airport is 20 min away (35$ for a cab), Bondi beach is 2 beaches away :p (20min), and peroquees are all around:)"

Room was comfortable as was the bed. Large, easy share kitchen well organized and clean. The only negative (for me with recent hip replacement surgery) was all hand washing sinks except kitchen sink were one flight of stairs down. Immediate neighborhood pretty residential. Commerce and Coogee Beach just a short walk."

All of them have been lovely and made me feel very welcome even if I was there for a short amount of time. \nThe room was immense and everything was super clean. \nThe location is perfect for access to Coogee beach and multiple food options. Many buses options also to go to CBD.\nAll in all probably one of the best air BnB I've been to."

We loved staying here, the place is well equipped with cooking and cleaning facilities. Only downside is the slow Wi-Fi but I believe David is already on the case! Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to visit Sydney but wants to stay near the coast!"
