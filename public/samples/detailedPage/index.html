                    Newly appointed space sitting at the edge of the 900-foot Waipio cliffside, mere paces from the Waipi'o lookout. The modern amenities include a large walk-in closet, kitchenette, four-post teak queen bed, 200 sq ft private deck (peek-a-boo ocean views), walk-in natural stone-tiled shower, granite counters, toaster, coffeemaker, smart TV, propane BBQ, small fridge, hot plate, and housewares. The suite has two private entrances and sits on an acre of lush property. You'll feel right at home here! The guest suite, or Ohana, is located on an acre of property covered in lush flora (much of which is edible). The views from our cliff edge are one of a kind. The valley, sky, ocean, views of Maui are ever-changing. The reviews give you an idea of what it has to offer. We are very into sustainability- the house runs on a fraction of the energy it generates via solar, and we work toward living off the land. Being avid travelers ourselves, we are happy to share some local advice and tips with you
