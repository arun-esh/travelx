    <p class="privacy-pTag">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
        services to post a privacy
        policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
        (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from
        California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
        collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to update that policy whenever changes are
        made to the law. - See more at:
